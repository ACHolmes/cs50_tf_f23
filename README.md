# Andrew's CS50 TF Materials, Fall 2023

This repo stores all of my public resources as TF for CS50 for the fall 2023 semester, including all section slides and other materials I create for section each week.

## Structure

There are folders for:

* Each week's section material, e.g. `1_intro_to_c`.

    * These contain all materials I've created for section that week, including slides, exercises and anything else I come up with!

    * Will typically be structured with subfolders such as `slides`, `resources`, `exercises` and `extension` (if applicable, will see how this idea goes).

    * `slides`, `resources` and `exercises` should contain all the content for the section before section starts. `solutions` or `sols` will contain solutions to exercises either shortly after lab (if we finish everything) or slightly delayed in case I want to give you time to try them on your own first.
* `utils`, which contains a number of utilities that may or may not be of use to you. For example, the powerpoint theme I made in `utils`, in case you'd like to use it.

* `fall_2022`, which contains my teaching materials from Fall 2022. As with this year, there are solutions to exercises here, and I will try to display them (remove from `.gitignore`) in line with our progress this semester.

* `extension`, where I will try to maintain a growing set of content for those of you looking to push yourselves or explore a bit outside of the confines of cs50. 

    * This is NOT only for people who want to try harder versions of PSETs. I'm hoping to have a mix of content here, including putting links to articles, talks or other interesting content that any cs50 student could understand. 
    
    * I'm hopeful that several of these will give you ideas for directions you'd like to go after cs50, and to help prepare you even better for future CS classes. 

    * These are obviously not required, and if you have improvements or suggestions, I'd love to hear them, you can email me at aholmes@college.harvard.edu :)
