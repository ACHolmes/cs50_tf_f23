            Here is a container to get you started. All your HTML should go within this div.
             Take a look at the CSS provided for this class. What does it do? You may want to try by adding
             something within this div and then following the instructions in the CSS file. 
        -->

        <!--
            Next, add an image and a div or paragraph with some text into this div. Does it look how you wanted?
             Why or why not? If your image is huge or tiny, try adding height="400" or similar within the img tag.
             This will set the height and maintain the original aspect ratio of the image.
        -->

        <!--
            Finally, see if you can fix the problem and have everything aligned horizontally while remaining
            perfectly in the center of the screen.
        -->
