# Extension possibilities

Here are some possible resources to glimpse content beyond the scope of CS50 that I think might interest you and is at a level that you should be able to understand 90% of what is said/written!

* [A great article about strlen and a few other bits](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/). Is `strlen` fast? Could we make it faster? Article written by Joel Spolsky, founder of Trello, Stack Overflow and more, so he knows what he's talking about! (short, <10 mins)

* [*(char*) 0 = 0](https://youtu.be/dFIqNZ8VbRY?si=LfeA-SYgSjX0GJ07) talk by JF Bastien. This is a talk which is based around C++, but the first half shouldn't have too much outside CS50 range. If you're willing to Google a few things along the way, this is a interesting, fun and perhaps slightly bizarre talk given by JF Bastien, who is the chair of the C++ language evolution working group, and has worked on a number of extremely important systems projects including LLVM and WebAssembly. (long, 60 mins, one of the harder things I'll put on here)
